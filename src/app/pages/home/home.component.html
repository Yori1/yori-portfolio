                    I'm a Dutch student at Fontys University of Applied Sciences where I'm currently studying
                    Software
                    Engineering and
                    Smart Mobile.

                <p>
                    I have experience making desktop
                    applications, fullstack webapplications, mobile applications and APIs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I'm not working on software, I like playing video games, exercising or learning Japanese.

                An application made to help users specifically train their ability to read words in kanji (漢字).
                It's different from a flash-card app, because the app can assemble a list of Japanese sentences for the words the user wants to learn,
                 by querying the public Tatoeba-database with thousands of real Japanese sentences in it. 

            </p>
            <p>
                Japanese readings of kanji are generated using the MeCab library for Japanese character transcription.

            </p>

            <p>
                Users can practice their sentences by themselves, or they can challenge other players who are online in a race to see who can accurately answer the fastest.
